# Juliet
Virtual Assistant with STT and TTS

Juliet answers to any name starting Juli.  So you can say "Juli Help," or "Julie Help," or "Juliet Help," or "Julius Help."

Juliet requires quite a few packages and programs to run.  I've built Juliet on Ubuntu 18.04.  I have a modern Logitek Webcam and integrated microphone, but any microphone should work.  The pyaudio program is used to access the microphone.  I recommend doing everything inside a virtual environment.  I use miniconda.  BTW, I am programming this at home.  I don't have a team, and I don't have a lab with multiple systems with different linuxes and different hardware.  I have a lot of programs and modules installed.  I don't know how my particular system is effecting this program as a unique environment.  Therefore, I'd be very interested in hearing about your experiences.  You can create a Github issue in this repository to leave your experiences.
